/*! \page escaping Escaping Strings 

\note Before you read this, remember escaping strings directly and including them in SQL statements is \a bad idea, you should
use \ref stat "prepared statements" instead. However if you really know what you are doing, continue reading.


You can escape strings from unknown source using session's \ref cppdb::session::escape() "escape()" functions. Also
note that they do not add first and last quotation marks and you are expected to do this on your own.

For example:

\code
std::string safe_data = sql.escape(data);
sql << "INSERT INTO names(name) values('" + safe_data + "')" << cppdb::exec;
\endcode

Please notice the quotes inserted in the query.

But still it is better to do following:

\code
sql << "INSERT INTO names(name) values(?)" << data << cppdb::exec;
\endcode

\note \ref odbc "ODBC" backend does not support escaping strings and would throw \ref cppdb::not_supported_by_backend "not_supported_by_backend" exception.
