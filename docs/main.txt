/*! \mainpage CppDB - SQL Connectivity Library

CppDB is an SQL connectivity library that is designed to provide platform
and Database independent connectivity API similarly to what JDBC, ODBC and
other connectivity libraries do.

CppDB was designed with following goals in the mind:

- Performance is the primary goal - make fastest possible SQL connectivity as possible
- Transparent connection pooling support
- Transparent prepared statements caching 
- Dynamic DB modules loading and optional static linking
- Full and high priority support of FOSS RDBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sqlite3
- Support as many  RDBMSs as possible via cppdb-odbc bridge
- Simplicity in use
- Locale safety
- Support of both explicit verbose API and brief and nice syntactic sugar

This library was developed on the base of experience with SOCI, libdbi and
other SQL Connectivity libraries.

The library is released under LGPLv3 license.
